# flare_id
This module is for identifying flares in light curves from _TESS_ and _Kepler_ data. It is composed of two classes: the `Star` class and `Flares` class. See the [`flare_finding_example`](https://github.com/iveydavis/flare_id/blob/main/flare_finding_example.ipynb) notebook for information on how to use the code.
